# Lulu's Shenanigans, what's that ?

It's my personal blog built using [gohugo](https://gohugo.io/). You can check it out at [lulushenanigans.me](https://lulushenanigans.me).

# I want to build it

No worries, you just have to install [hugo](https://gohugo.io) and then a simple :

```
git clone https://github.com/lucienastie/Shenanigans
cd Shenanigans
hugo -D server
```
